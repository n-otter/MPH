# Multiparameter persistent homology

Here you can find code for the computation of invariants of multiparameter persistence modules.


## Computation of homology of chain complex.

Here we provide a code that takes as input a  simplicial complex together with a one-critical bifiltration and builds the  associated chain complex:





Here we provide a code to compute the rank of the module, using the reduction to a line of Section \ref{S:restriction to line}.
